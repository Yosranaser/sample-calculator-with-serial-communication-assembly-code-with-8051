# sample-calculator-with-serial-communication-assembly-code-with-8051
##This project is a simple application on serial communication


##the user will input the first number , the operation and second number by keypad which connected to the first micrcontroller(master) which will send it 
asynchronously to the second micrcontroller(slave) which will calculate the operation on the two numbers and then send the result to  the first micrcontroller(master)
